TODO-list for the CSL IoT workshop
----------------------------------

Architecture:
* Have a publically available SicsthSense with a *static* IPv6 [Niclas]
* Have a gogo6 RPL network [Joakim & Simon]

SicsthSense:
* CoAP polling and POST [Matthias]
* accept POST [Simon] => done
* expose streams through a RESTful interface [Simon]
* decent graphs display (choice of the x scale) [Simon]
* simple aggregation? (average, sum, etc?) [Simon]
* interactive RESTful interface (click on "POST /leds/red") [Simon]
* acting a proxy, having labels for devices (e.g. sense.sics.se/users/simonduq/phone) [Simon]
* enbygg-style control [Joakim]
* spontaneous registration (prefix based) [Simon]
* beautiful front-end!
* triggers: POST, cosm, twitter, mail

Contiki:
* posting to Cosm and SicsthSense [Joakim]
* examples for each platform we use (ipso-profile svn style) [all]
  full list here (devices and sensors):
	- sky
	- z1
	- ...
* pre-programming motes for the lab [all]
  full list here:
	- power meters?
	- H&D Wireless devices
	- ...

Scripting:
* make a few scripting examples for getting samples triggering actuation
  - simple RESTful program [Joakim]
  - python & java examples [Joakim]
  - ...
* example for posting something from a computer
  (local data, like CPU temp, light from webcam, or data from the web) [Joakim]

Android:
* Android app for submitting sensor data to SicsthSense [Matthias]
* Android app for looking at data - plenty out there already... (for COSM at least)

Texts for the lab:
  - write a small tutorial for people to start-up the lab
  - write a few "challenges" for people to complete
  - what type of application would we like to create during the "lab"?
  - presentation(s) [Simon & Joakim]
