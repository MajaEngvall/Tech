TODO-list for the CSL IoT workshop
----------------------------------
Mobile:
* Android app for submitting sensor data to COSM / SicsthSense
* Android app for looking at data - plenty out there already...
  (for COSM at least).
* 

Sensor Network - IoT sensors
* finalize IoT applications - JSON Websense, etc. Both submission to COSM
  and SicsthSense
* Pre-programmed motes for temp, humidity, light, etc.
* A few pre-programmed power meters (3?)
* H&D Wireless devices - pre-configured for local WiFi network
  (power meter + switch)


Cloud:
* make SicsthSense ready for the lab... whatever is missing needs
  to be implemented soon!


Scripting:
* make a few scripting examples
  python
  curl (?)
  Java (?)
  - what more -?


Application
What type of application would we like to create during the "lab".
- energy related since we have both switches for that and sensors for
  that


Texts...
- write a small tutorial for people to start-up the lab
- write a few "challenges" for people to complete
...
