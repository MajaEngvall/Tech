To install Play go to: http://www.playframework.com/

There is a default configuration file in 'conf/application.conf.default' simply copy this to 'conf/application.conf' and modify the SQL password.

Your application can be compiled and packaged using `play dist`, it can then be started with `play start`.

If you would like to simply run the web interface in a live testing mode then just `play run` will work. This mode will be slower than dist/start.

Play has now been consumed by the more general "activator":

Hence `activator dist` will also work.
